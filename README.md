# CICS Showdown: Battle your way through the CICS curriculum

Fight your way through the CICS curriculum, collecting your favorite professors. Take note of the unique moves each professor has, reflecting their unique character and personality. Craft strategies in order to best these virtual professors, if you can.

# A look on the inside

We used a react front end, built by half of the group, and a game engine built by the other half. The entire project is written in typescript, and compiled by node into a static website rendered by github pages.

# Challenges we ran into

We struggled at times to integrate the two groups, and of course both sides struggled to debug their codebase. Overall, the project went fairly smoothly with a few minor road bumps.

# Accomplishments we're proud of

We had a lot of fun designing the moves, making some UIs, and seeing all of our work integrate together into a project that's fairly enjoyable with a lot of jokes internal to the CS department.

# What we learned

We all had different backgrounds with webdev and typescript, so we all learned different things through this project. Since many of us were unfamiliar with typescript, we got a chance to familiarize ourselves with it and now feel more comfortable with the language. Git was also extremely intertwined within our project as we were sharing code snippets across our devices, which is difficult especially when handling merge conflicts. Now we definitely feel more comfortable than we ever thought we'd be.

# What's next for CICS Showdown

Maybe we'll polish it up later on. UIs can always be improved upon, and the game engine could use expansion. There's also expansion in terms of creating more levels for players to enjoy. Overall, there's a lot of potential for improvements.
